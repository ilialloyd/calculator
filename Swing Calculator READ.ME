This project is the projects that I did after learn swing 

It is beginner calculator

How does it work?

It has 4 operators and equal method. Clear and dot/point extras.

Cal. can calculate only one process at the same time 2+2 =

if you want to do more, like (2+3+5*3) you need to go step by step - 2+2=4 + 5 =9 * 3

Thank you
